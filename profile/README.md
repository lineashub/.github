## Who are we?
We are a rail freight company on a mission!
Our mission is to decarbonize your supply chain. Today, around 10% of Europe's CO2 emissions come from freight transport. Trucks are the main cause, as they handle 75% of all freight.

Drivers spend an average of 120 hours in traffic jams yearly, and sadly, air pollution and road accidents lead to 50,000 premature deaths.

## Our values
