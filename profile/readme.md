Lineas is the largest private rail freight operator in Europe.

The primary business activity of Lineas is the transport of goods by rail. The company has proclaimed its ambition to realise a ‘modal shift’ in Europe, moving a greater amount of freight off the road and onto rail. This is in line with the European Union’s goal of reducing CO2 emissions by 60% by 2050.
